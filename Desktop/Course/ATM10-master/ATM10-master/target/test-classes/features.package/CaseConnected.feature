Feature: Case Search and Checklist

  Background:
    Given I logged in the CMS

  Scenario: Searching case on Case Search
    When I create case
    And I search for created case in Case Search page
    Then the case is found

  Scenario Outline: Complete Checklist
    When I create case
    And I add party with type "<partyType>" and role "<partyRole>"
    And I add case event
    And I add case caption and case title
    Then checklist is absent on Case View page

    Examples:
      | partyType   | partyRole   |
      | Party       | Claimant    |
      | Participant | Third Party |
